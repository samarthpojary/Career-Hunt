# Career-Hunt
The Career Hunt system is a web-based job portal designed to streamline the campus recruitment process by bridging the gap between students and recruiters. This system provides a centralized platform where students can register, upload resumes, search for jobs, and track their applications, while recruiters can post job vacancies, filter candidates, and manage the hiring process. The system also includes an admin panel for managing user accounts, approving job postings, and monitoring platform usage.
